Works on Windows. Should be good for others too. ($ is whatever directory you're in, in command prompt. eg. C:/Users/Username>)

do

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

open the text file, replace the == with >=

then do

$ pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

If you have a problem with a certain package stalling the upgrade (numpy sometimes), just go to the directory ($), comment out the name (add a # before it) and run the upgrade again. You can later uncomment that section back. This is also great for copying python global environments.

I also like the pip-review method:

py2
$ pip install pip-review

$ pip-review --local --interactive

py3
$ pip3 install pip-review

$ py -3 -m pip_review --local --interactive

You can select 'a' to upgrade all packages; if one upgrade fails, run it again and it continues at the next one.
